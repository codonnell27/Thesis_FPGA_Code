NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

INFO:

   Logic has been added to automatically put the DCMs in auto-calibration
   mode if the clock input or clock feedback ever stops. This is recommended
   to ensure that the DCMs will maintain maximum operating frequency for the
   following Virtex-4 devices: Production Step 2 for LX/SX, and all Productions
   for FX.  The extra logic insertion can be disabled by placing the
   DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION=FALSE attribute on each applicable DCM or by setting
   the environment variable XIL_DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_OFF.  For more information
   regarding the DCM auto-calibration mode, please consult Answer Record 21435.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:796 - Due to DCM autocalibration, the DCM component U1/DCM1 in your
   design has a new hierarchical name: DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_U1/DCM1/U1/DCM1. Your
   simulation or formal verification flow may be affected.
INFO:MapLib:796 - Due to DCM autocalibration, the DCM component U1/DCM2 in your
   design has a new hierarchical name: DCM_AUTOCALIBRATION_U1/DCM2/U1/DCM2. Your
   simulation or formal verification flow may be affected.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 313 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
 309 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
